Practicals for the Module "Causal Inference" at the Academy for PhD Training in Statistics 
(https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/programme/causinf/)


For APTS we recommend using the Codespace set up by Louis Aslett for the Machine Learning module.


If you use your own machine, ensure you have R v4.0.0 or higher. 
**Windows users, please make sure that rtools is installed on your computer!** 
(https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

>ðŸ’¡ **Note:** <br>
> A step-by-step guide on how to install the package can be found here:

## **Code Snippets**
Visit https://bips-hb.github.io/APTS_Causal_Inference/docs/articles/Commands.html
for a collection of handy code snippets. These are typical R commands for conducting causal inference.
They help solving the practical exercises in this course and 
support understanding and application of the discussed methods.
The full solutions will be provided during the course.
